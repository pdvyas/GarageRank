Sync and Search you browsing activity on the cloud
==================================================

FWT ! What about my privacy ?
-----------------------------

Nopes, with GarageRank, you will be hosting this on your own cloud based server, so you will own it ! We are working on it. For now ( pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-alpha stage ) it all goes to a MongoDB instance hosted on www.mongolabs.com. We advice you clear your browser history and visit few innocent webpages and test the features.


What to look for ?
------------------
* Encrypted storage of the history, just in case ... !
* A Chrome extension we are buidling. FF will be next.
* Searching your browsing history even if you have removed it from your browser.
* Cool analytics that we will be able to collect, as your history data grows into days to weeks to months to years.
* Few other cool things we are day dreaming.



What are you plans !
