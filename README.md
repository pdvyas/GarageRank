FWT ! What about my privacy ?
-----------------------------

Nopes, with GarageRank, you will be hosting this on your own cloud based server, so you will own it ! We are working on it. For now ( pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-alpha stage ) it all goes to a MongoDB instance hosted on www.mongolabs.com. We advice you clear your browser history and visit few innocent webpages and test the features.

Also, We are open to feedback and criticism. Code contribution is the reason why we are on github. Fork us for sure !


What to look for ?
------------------
* Encrypted storage of the history, just in case ... !
* A Chrome extension we are buidling. FF will be next.
* Searching your browsing history even if you have removed it from your browser.
* Cool analytics that we will be able to collect, as your history data grows into days to weeks to months to years.
* Using free services like AWS Free Tier and others to host an entire stack.
* Few other cool things we are day dreaming.




What are you plans !

FAQs
----


* Why I will put up my server ?
Because you are scared (rightfully!) that you privacy can be breached. If you put that on your own server your privacy will be in your own hand. 

* But aren't setting up server a lot of hassle ? 
Depends on how you value your privacy. But, you will, most likely use the one-click installation scripts to put the things in place. We are working on it.

* Will those server cost me ?
May be. It all depends where you set it up. For most of you out there, some services, like Aamazon Web Service, provide a free tier to experiment. It may suffice your needs.
